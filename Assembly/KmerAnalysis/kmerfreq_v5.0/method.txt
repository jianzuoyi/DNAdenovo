Method:
the kmers are created by moving a k-length frame along each read base by base.If all the possible kmers of the genome are covered, the following formula can be used to caculate the genome size: G=base_num/base_depth=kmer_num/kmer_depth. It is supposed that the kmer depth distribution follows a Poission distribution, so the kmer expected depth is the peek depth. Then we get kmer expected depth and kmer total number to estimate the genome size.

Method in detail:
1. use the -a and -d to delete the bad sequencing part of each read, to reduce the influence of false ratio on the kmer frequence curve.
2. kmerfreq will first caculate the frequence of each kmer, use these data to plot the kmer depth ~ frequency curve and kmer depth ~ depth*frequence curve.
3. It is supposed that the kmer depth distribution follows a Poission distribution, so the kmer expected depth is the peek depth. 
4. When all the possible kmers of the genome are covered, the following formula can be used to caculate the genome size: G=base_num/base_depth=kmer_num/kmer_depth. 

Attention:
For kmer frequence analysis, The key problem is how to get precise expect kmer depth. 
We get two curves: depth~frequency(kmer depth distribution curve) and depth*freqeuence ~ frequence(kmer depth product curve), It is advised to use the peek depth of kmer depth product curve ,minus 1,  as the kmer expected depth.
